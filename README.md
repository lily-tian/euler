# Project Euler
*lily.tian*

Project Euler is a series of computational challenges hosted online at https://projecteuler.net. Included here are algorithms that solve each of the listed problems on the site.

These solutions are for personal archival purposes only, and to document my progess in mathematics and java programming. No external sources were consulted in the completion of each problem.

This is not an online guide. In the spirit of the game, please do not read these solutions if you are a fellow Eulerian and/or intend to join the challenge at some point!
